<h1>About Us</h1>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>WHOW is a local grassroots organization of Rochester women with the common goal of
helping women in Rochester and around the world.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>WHOW was formed in October 2010 as a spinoff from a longtime Rochester women’s
bookclub.  Inspired by the book Half the Sky, by renowned Pulitzer Prize
winning journalists Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, the
host of that meeting asked if others were interested in forming a group that would make a
difference for women in the world.  She also asked other women she knew and hosted a kickoff meeting.
<h3>The Kickoff</h3> 
On Saturday October 23, several of these women met for a kitchen table discussion of
what we – collectively and individually -- wanted this group to be and do. These were busy women, many still working and/or volunteering full time.  All were women of action, women with a lifelong
love of learning and women who truly cared about the world. We agreed immediately that we
wanted to give in multiple ways, besides writing checks. We all knew the power of volunteering,
sharing resources, skills, and in-kind giving. Two hours later, WHOW had sufficiently
formed a simple plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The focus would be women.</li>
  <li>The name evolved quickly: Women Helping Other Women.</li>
  <li>WHOW would help women both locally and internationally.</li>
  <li>Once a month the group would meet for 1 ½ hours.</li>
<li>Each meeting would focus on a local project and an international project.</li>
<li>Between meetings, work on those projects would be done by individual members with occasional work sessions for sewing, assembling a variety of kits for those in need, etc...</li>
</ul>
